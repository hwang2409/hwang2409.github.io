Last year was pretty eventful, I landed my first internship, moved out, and finally figured out what I wanted in life.

Last summer, I interned at [NationGraph](https://www.nationgraph.com/). It was my first look into having any industry experience and I learnt a lot, however, I also regret a lot.

I'm extremely lucky to have had that internship under my belt, as it's helped me tremendously in both recruiting and building my own projects. I finally started understanding the importance of knowing full stack development, and to this day, the lessons I've learnt during that internship have to stuck with me.
However, a part of me wished I worked harder, did more with my time, so I could have had even more experience under my belt. In the moment, once I got the internship, I felt safe, and thus, got lazy. I coasted, barely even that. Sure I did my fair share of work, but I coasted rather than pushing myself to do what I expected of myself.

When I first got into programming, I was inspired by Mark Zuckerberg in the Social Network, minus all the backstabbing part. I was excited to make new things, learn more, discover what the little box in front of me could truly do. But, after a certain point, it stopped being about exploration and fun, but rather, it became a chore. I stopped working on passion projects, started working on things with the purpose of boosting my resume. I stopped doing it for me, and started doing it for money.

I've been coasting for so long, but I figured it was finally time to start taking some agency in my life.
